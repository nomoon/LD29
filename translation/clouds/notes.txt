TO ESCAPE MARIO'S VENGEANCE
THE LAKITU FLED DEEPER INTO
THE CLOUDS.

THEIR ONCE PROUD SKY KINGDOM
LOOMS, ABANDONED BUT NOT
FORGOTTEN.

YOU MAY NOW WALK ON CLOUDS.

I HEAR THE RUMBLINGS OF AN
ANCIENT EVIL, ONCE SLUMBERING
BUT SOON TO WAKE.

THEY CALL ME MAD. BUT I KNOW
THE TRUTH.

YOU MAY NOW WALK ON CLOUDS.
